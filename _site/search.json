All lectures will take place in person at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Inselstrasse 22, 04103 Leipzig. Any deviation from the schedule will be announced.\n\n\nCourse Outline\nThe goal is to build enough background such that one can study the Broadhurst-Kreimer or Brown-Schnetz papers. Meaning that we will focus more on the appearance of multiple zeta zalues in Feynman integrals, periods and their arithmetic geometry.\nHowever, the arithmetic geometric structure of Feynman integrals goes beyond MZVs, as is recently seen in the Banana graphs where periods of Calabi-Yau motives appear.\nLecture 1: 21.10.2024: Motivating Feynman integrals and their arithemtic structure  Lecture 2: 28.10.2024: Graph theory  Lecture 3: 4.11.2024: Homology of graphs, Symanzik polynomials, Feynman Graphs  11.11.2024: No Lectures  18.11.2024: No Lectures  Lecture 4: 25.11.2024: Parametrizations of Feynman integrals from Feynman Graphs, graph hypersurfaces  Lecture 5: 02.12.2024: Periods and Multiple Zeta Values (MZV’s) Lecture 7: 09.12.2024: More on MZVs, Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture, Zagier conjecture  Lecture 6: 16.12.2024: Singular, Betti and algebraic de Rham cohomology of smooth affine varieties  Lecture 8: 06.01.2025: Algebraic de Rham cohomology of smooth non-affine varieties, Relative cohomology, comparison isomorphism  Lecture 9: 13.01.2025: Proof of comparison isomorphism, GAGA theorem, periods revisited Lecture 10: 20.01.2025: MZVs as periods, mixed Hodge structures and Mixed Tate Motives over \\(\\mathbb Z\\)  Lecture 11: 27.01.2025: MZVs as periods, mixed Hodge structures and Mixed Tate Motives over \\(\\mathbb Z\\)  Lecture 12: 03.02.2025: The Kontsevich conjecture and disproof (Belkale-Brosnan, Brown-Schnetz) \n\n\nLiterature\nThere is no literature source in particular that one should consult. The most comprehensive source is the book by Stefan Weinzierl, which is available on the arxiv: Feynman Integrals - Stefan Weinzierl. I will base the course roughly around expanding Section 1 of Feynman integrals and motives by Matilde Marcolli with a significant amount of arithmetic geometry and number theory.\nIf you are interested in learning how other special functions and period integrals appear in Feynman integrals, Feynman itegrals, toric geometry and mirror symmetry by Pierre Vanhove is a good resource.\n\n\nCourse Notes\nStill being typeset as a part of a larger series of notes on arithmetic and number theory of Feynman integrals!\nPlease email me for a scan of the notes, or for video recordings."

These objects play a central role in modern mathematics and are crucial to making progress towards some of the biggest problems in mathematics. For most of the course, we will deal with the simplest automorphic forms viz., modular forms. The course will begin with introducing the theory of elliptic functions and elliptic curves. We will then see how modular forms arise from the theory of elliptic functions. We will then study the key properties of modular forms (the structure of spaces, algebra etc). We will then consider generalizations of modular forms to other abelian varieties. We shall then turn focus to L-functions which we motivate through the theory of Hecke eigenforms. L-functions serve as a bridge between modular forms and arithmetic. Following study of some fundamental properties of L-functions, We shall then consider two kinds of L-functions (the Dirichlet L-functions and L-functions of elliptic curves).\nWe shall then spend the final three lectures discussing applications and stating open problems. The open problems we will introduce here are the Riemann Hypothesis, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Amongst the applications, we shall consider the relation between Diophantine analysis and the Modularity theorem which solves Fermat’s last theorem by placing the L-functions of elliptic curves and L-functions of certain Hecke eigenforms on the same footing.\nThe two lectures on applications will be divided into two: The first being applications in physics. The second being computational. In applications to physics, we shall discuss string amplitudes and BPS partition functions. We shall also go over the case of various moonshine phenomena. In application to computing, we shall consider the application of modular forms and L functions to cryptography and error correcting codes.\nTo make calculations faster, some computer algebra such as SageMath, Pari/GP, and/or Mathematical packages will be made available.\nTarget audience: Mathematics undergraduate and master’s students, PhD candidates/postdocs in mathematical physics and string theory. Those with interests to learn and discuss are also welcome to attend the course."
