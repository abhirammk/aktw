title: Advanced Course on Black Holes
---

#### SoSe 2022 @ Leibniz Universitaet Hannover.

[Course announcement](https://qis.verwaltung.uni-hannover.de/qisserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=360488&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung)

This is an intensive course aimed primarily at Master's and PhD students in gravitational/high-energy/astro-particle/mathematical physics. Advanced Bachelor's students are also encouraged to attend. The course assumes comfort with derivations and calculations in general relativity/pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Due to the variety of background of expected audience and time limit, proofs will not be presented during the lecture unless it is absolutely vital. They can otherwise be covered during office hours.

### Logistics

Course spacetime coordinates: Tuesday 7th June 2022 - Friday 10th June 2022, Lecture Hall 267, Appelstrasse 2  
2 x 2hr lectures a day: 10:00 - 12:00 CET and 14:00 - 16:00 CET

**Students are strongly encouraged to approach me during office hours so as to not fall behind on understanding.**

### Prerequisites

*   General relativity or knowledge of differentible pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
*   Knowledge of mathematica/maple will be advantageous
*   Mode expansions in QFT following the first few chapters of [Srednicki's book](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/ms-qft-DRAFT.pdf) will be useful

### Course outline

*   Stellar Collapse
*   Black Hole Geometries and Geodesics in 4d
*   Black Hole Mechanics
*   Black Hole Thermodynamics and Evaporation

### Literature

There are no particualar course notes that we will follow. The standard textbooks for reference are:

*   Wald - General Relativity
*   Hawking & Ellis - Large Scale Structure of Spacetime
*   Sachs & Wu - General Relativity for Mathematicians
*   Carroll - Spacetime and Geometry
*   [Lecture Notes](http://www.blau.itp.unibe.ch/GRLecturenotes.html) by Matthias Blau (link to website, not .pdf file)
*   O'Neill - Semi-Riemannian Geometry

Paul Townsend's [lecture notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9707012) and Piotr Chruschiel's [notes on the geometry of black holes](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/piotr.chrusciel/teaching/Black Holes/BlackHolesVienna.pdf) are all time classics and my personal favourites.
